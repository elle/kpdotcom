What is Agile Web Development?\r\n\r\nSpending many months documenting requirements and design before starting coding is yesterday’s approach to software development. It fails to acknowledge fundamental characteristics of software. For example, many people start with a vague idea of what they want software to do. It is only when they start to use the software that more detailed requirements form in their minds. \r\n\r\nOne response to the inadequacy of the old _waterfall_ method has been the emergence of the _Agile_ approach in recent years. Iterative, incremental delivery involving close collaboration between software provider and customer is a key emphasis of the agile approach, which is well suited to development of dynamic web applications.\r\n\r\nh3. Ruby on Rails\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/rails.png\" alt=\"rails\" height=\"64\" width=\"50\" vspace=\"5\" hspace=\"30\" align=\"left\" />When delivering web applications it is crucial to able to provide rapid feedback to customers in the form of working software. That’s why I prefer delivering dynamic web applications using the \"Ruby on Rails\":http://rubyonrails.org (RoR) web application framework. RoR is an open source web application framework based on the Ruby programming language. Open-sourced in mid-2004, RoR fosters rapid, agile development due in part to its philosophy of _convention over configuration_.\r\n\r\nh2. What do I offer?\r\n\r\nI offer development of dynamic web applications. Put simply, these are often databases with a web front-end.\r\n\r\nMy approach is to regularly deliver features, starting with those that will give you, the customer, the most value. I can help you by transforming your concept into a deployed web application, guiding the evolution every step of the way.\r\n\r\nh2. My experience\r\n\r\nIn addition to my extensive experience of building web applications using Java EE, I have explored RoR since the day it was open-sourced and have built several RoR applications for business, personal and family use. Since the beginning of 2008 my client work has been almost exclusively Rails development. From 29 May to 1 June, 2008 I extended my knowledge of Rails by attending RailsConf in Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nI have presented Ruby-related talks at the 2007 and 2008 Open Source Developers' Conferences in Australia. In December 2008 I presented a talk about _\"Automated Testing with Ruby\":http://keithpitty.com/blog/archives/2008-12-08-automated-testing-with-ruby_. In November 2007 I presented a paper entitled _\"Why would a Java shop want to use Ruby?\":http://osdc2007.cgpublisher.com/proposals/47_ at the Open Source Developers' Conference in Brisbane (\"slides here\":http://www.slideshare.net/keithpitty/why-would-a-java-shop-want-to-use-ruby).\r\n\r\nOf several talks I have given at the Sydney Rails Group the most recent was about _What's new in Rails 2.1_ at the \"June 2008 meeting\":http://rubyonrails.com.au/2008/6/11/sydney-meetup-june-2008 (\"slides here\":http://www.slideshare.net/keithpitty/whats-new-in-rails-21).

What is Agile Web Development?\r\n\r\nSpending many months documenting requirements and design before starting coding is yesterday’s approach to software development. It fails to acknowledge fundamental characteristics of software. For example, many people start with a vague idea of what they want software to do. It is only when they start to use the software that more detailed requirements form in their minds. \r\n\r\nOne response to the inadequacy of the old _waterfall_ method has been the emergence of the _Agile_ approach in recent years. Iterative, incremental delivery involving close collaboration between software provider and customer is a key emphasis of the agile approach, which is well suited to development of dynamic web applications.\r\n\r\nh3. Ruby on Rails\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/rails.png\" alt=\"rails\" height=\"64\" width=\"50\" vspace=\"5\" hspace=\"30\" align=\"left\" />When delivering web applications it is crucial to able to provide rapid feedback to customers in the form of working software. That’s why I prefer delivering dynamic web applications using the \"Ruby on Rails\":http://rubyonrails.org (RoR) web application framework. RoR is an open source web application framework based on the Ruby programming language. Open-sourced in mid-2004, RoR fosters rapid, agile development due in part to its philosophy of _convention over configuration_.\r\n\r\nh2. What do I offer?\r\n\r\nI offer development of dynamic web applications. Put simply, these are often databases with a web front-end.\r\n\r\nMy approach is to regularly deliver features, starting with those that will give you, the customer, the most value. I can help you by transforming your concept into a deployed web application, guiding the evolution every step of the way.\r\n\r\nh2. My experience\r\n\r\nIn addition to my extensive experience of building web applications using Java EE, I have explored RoR since the day it was open-sourced and have built several RoR applications for business, personal and family use. Since the beginning of 2008 my client work has been almost exclusively Rails development. From 29 May to 1 June, 2008 I extended my knowledge of Rails by attending RailsConf in Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nAt the 2007 and 2008 Open Source Developers\' Conferences in Australia I presented Ruby-related talks.
